          When creating an order in Recomm, set <span>Shipping calculation</span> as <span>Rebilly</span>, got 422.
          <br><span>deliveryAddress</span> is sent in the payload, response message is
          <span>Shipping is not available</span>
          <div style="margin-top: 15px">
            <img src="./1.png" height="876" width="1008"/>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>ü§î We also tried to use the instruments lib, it's confusing that the <span>Shipping</span> is still 0, <span>deliveryAddress</span>
          is sent in the <span>preview-purchase POST</span> api, it seems the backend ignored it, didn't calculate the
          shipping.

        <li>
          ‚ùå The same with Recomm, although we switched to use instrument lib, after clicking the <span>Confirm</span> button, <span>storefront/organizations/org_01JNN4CS8FMV6ZPFYD439YPMFW/purchase POST</span>got 422.
