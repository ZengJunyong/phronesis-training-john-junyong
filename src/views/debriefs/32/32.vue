        <li>Documentation for user permissions was easy to find and the information is sufficient to start creating roles.</li>

      <h2>What did you find confusing? Did you encounter any issues?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the Role form, the "permissions" textarea does not have any meaningful instructions.
          <br>
          It is unclear whether multiple permissions need to be in a new line or separated by commas.
          <br>
          Also, we accidentally added whitespace and it triggers a validation error. FE logic should remove the whitespace.

        <li>
          Opinion: The Role template field in the users form should be in the Role form instead of user form.
          <br>
          It can be confusing because the thought process is to start creating roles first before the users.
          <br>
          We created our own custom roles before realizing that there are a few predefined roles.

        <li>
          The storefront related permissions in the <a href="https://www.rebilly.com/docs/settings/user-permissions/">User permission doc page</a> can cause confusion.
          <br>
          We know exactly what storefront is, but our customers may not so they may not realized the difference between "PostTransaction" vs "StorefrontPostTransaction".
          <br>
          A footnote describing/linking storefront info page can be useful in this case.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is confusing that when we checked the <a href="https://www.rebilly.com/docs/settings/user-permissions">documentation</a>, the KYC resource section does not mention anything about depending on Attachment-related permissions.
          <br>
          A KYC agent would need those attachment permissions. We think its worth adding a note section under KYC to specify this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many resource page would also need custom fields related permissions in order for user to view all the information related to that resource?
        </li>
        <li>
          Opinion: In the billing portal, its confusing to have the person icon.
          <br>
          It indicates that there is such a thing as user avatar, which there isn't.

          Closing a gateway account does not redirect back to the Gateway account page.

          In customer action, the "Billing portal link" is available even when users do have sufficient permissions.

          (POST /authentication-tokens)
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Role form, the "Include roles" has an empty dropdown unless some roles have been created.
          <br>
          This was unclear in the beginning when we had no roles created. In this case, the field should be hidden.
          <div style="margin-top: 15px">

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          We see a blank page for the billing portal page (/billing-portals) when user do not have the correct permissions.
          <br>
          User should get redirected back or the route cancelled.
